    "Since we don't know the population standard deviation, we'll use the sample standard deviation as an estimate. The formula for calculating the t-score associated with our level of confidence and degrees of freedom (df = n - 1) is:\n",

    "t = t.ppf(1 - alpha/2, df=n-1)\n",
    "where alpha is 1 - our level of confidence (0.01 in this case).\n",

    "Margin of Error = t*(s/√n)\n",
